# LEDs-get-crazy Demo Payloads
Some demo payloads for the big LED matrix! Make the 1152 LEDs your own ðŸŽ‰

If these are getting boring ...

```bash
echo -ne '\xff\x00\x00\x00\xff\x00\x00\x00\xff' | nc -u 100.91.88.116 54321
cat /dev/urandom | nc -u 100.91.88.116 54321
```

... then take a look at these python examples to get a hang, then create even cooler things ðŸ˜Ž
Feel free to make a pull request with your own payload!
